  <p>
    I am a mathematician with a strong background in applied modeling and computational analysis. My current work focuses on the integration of uncertainty-aware predictive models into decision-making processes for complex systems.
  </p>
  <p>
  Through my doctoral research, I focus on integrating uncertainty into predictive models to improve decision-making in emergency response systems. I study how incomplete information and intervention-induced behavioral changes affect planning and resource allocation. At DataLab, I contribute to the development of data-driven tools for assessing health risks, optimizing interventions, and supporting public sector decision-making.
